    new_home_head: YOUR NEW HOME
    new_home_1: EcoFrameHouse builds ecological, unique and sustainable
                houses.
    new_home_2: Handcrafted timberframes are the load bearing
                structure of an eco frame house.
    new_home_3: In the traditional english Timberframe technique large wood is
                joined without the use of metal.
    eco_head: Ecological House
    eco_1: EcoFrameHouse is built completely from natural materials,
           diffusion open, and very well insulated.
           The core structure, the timberframe, is made from large whole timber,
           and around it a light, but thick, insulation layer keeps the house warm.
           Since all materials are wood based (wood, paper etc, no plastic), the
           air is clean and healthy.
    eco_2: We have developed the EcoFrameHouse concept from years of building
           experience, to unite both traditional techiques and materials, with
           modern high standards.
           The visible timberframe on the inside gives the house a solid feel and
           beautiful look. While the unbroken thick insulation layer (no cold bridges)
           gives the house outstanding thermal qualities. This in turn means
           a lovely warm feeling inside, and very low heating costs.
    tf_head: Timberframe structure
    tf_1: Timberframe is an old english technique of making structural joins
          on large timber. The technique has been used to build houses and churches,
          some of which are almost a thousand years old.
          The main join of the technique is the tennon and mortise join, in which
          the tennon is inserted into the mortise and secured by wooden pegs.
          Metal, like screws, nails or brackets are not used.
          The joins are excuted very precisely using a mix of power and hand-tools,
          and test fitted in the workshop for tight fit.
    tf_2: A frame that may take many weeks, even months to craft, may be assembled
          on site in one or two days.
    walls_head: Thick insulation layer
    walls_1: Since the timberframe is the structure of the house, the insulation
             layer does not need to carry the house.
             Thus it can be very lightweight and cost effective and provide a
             relatively large space for insulation, creating almost a passive house.
             Among the ecologic blown insulations available the most popular are
             paper based Ekovilla, or wood-fiber based Hunton.
             The diffusion barrier used in both cases in paper based, not plastic.

    walls_2: Since the insulation is completely outside the frame, the
             beautiful timberframe stays completely visible on the inside.
             The outer cladding can be any kind of wood panneling.
             Also the inside surfaces may be clad with wood panelling, but also
             other board solutions may be used, including eg. clay finishes.
    walls_3: ""
    walls_4: We source as much of the wood as possible locally from sustainable
             forests.
    home_head: Home
    home_1: The resulting house is ecological, beautiful and very energy efficient.
            The frame gives the space a very unique feel, that can be tailored
            to look more traditional or modern depending on finish.

    design_head: From design to execution
    design_1: EcoFrameHouse will help you all the way from inception to execution.
              If you have not found an architect, we can help you. We know
              the engineers and neccessary steps to get your dream house

    tool_head: Try yourself
    tool_1: The tool that you find behind the link below let's you plan
            an EcoFrameHouse. You can change the width and length, amount of posts, and change the angle of the roof. All in all it can give you a good idea of how an EcoFrameHouse will be built for your project.
