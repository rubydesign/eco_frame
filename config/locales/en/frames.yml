    timberframe: TIMBERFRAME
    explanation: Timberframing is an old english technique, used in thousand years
                 old churches and also boats. In Timberframing, large wood is joined
                 without nails, only using woorden pegs, the most common join being a
                 mortise and tennon.
                 The Timberframe revival started in America in the 70's, and
                 nowadays Timberframe houses are built again all over the world,
                 bringing together traditional techniques with modern architecture.
    in_house_head: Timberframe houses
    in_house_1: Timberframes are built from whole wood, usually quite large beams
                that we source locally. The frame is created by hand
                in our workshop and can be erected quite quickly on site.
    in_house_2: Precise work, and test fitting in the workshop, make for
                a very smooth raising process and allow to go from foundation
                to finished roof in a very short time.
    joins_head: Precise joins (mortise and tennon)
    joins_1: The diagram shows the most common join, a mortise and tennon.
             In this join, the tennon, created on one side, is inserted into the
             mortise (the hole) on the other side. The join is secured with
             wooden pins.
    sum_1: Using this and other joins we create beautiful, strong and long lasting
           structures that are both functional and ecological.

    poss_head: Solutions for many needs
    poss_1: The Timberframe can be used for many other structures, not just houses.
            Terasses, outhouses, greehouses and garages can all be created
            as timberframe structures.
